Bad Wolf
========

A color scheme for Vim, pieced together by [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/).

There's still quite a lot of room for improvement (particularly in HTML) so feel
free to send me ideas through the [issue tracker][] or pull requests.

**If you're going to send a pull request that you want me to merge, please post
a comment in it with before/after screenshots!**

I'd love pull requests, but won't necessarily merge all of them.  Color schemes
are a very subjective topic -- we don't all have the same taste.
